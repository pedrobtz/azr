# azr: Credential Chain for Seamless 'OAuth 2.0' Authentication to 'Azure Services'

Implements a credential chain for 'Azure OAuth 2.0' authentication based
on the package 'httr2”s 'OAuth' framework. Sequentially attempts
authentication methods until one succeeds. During development allows
interactive browser-based flows ('Device Code' and 'Auth Code' flows)
and non-interactive flow ('Client Secret') in batch mode.
